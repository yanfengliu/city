# Architecture

## Overview

Two threads. A Web Worker owns the simulation: a civ-engine `World` plus game systems, driven by the engine's own loop (20 TPS, speed-scaled). The main thread owns presentation: a Three.js scene, DOM HUD, and input. They speak a typed, JSON/structured-clone-safe protocol; the renderer never touches the World.

The worker does NOT use the engine's `ClientAdapter` or `RenderAdapter` classes. It drives the engine loop via `world.start()`/`setSpeed()`/`pause()`/`resume()`, submits commands directly via `world.submitWithResult` (custom `{type:'command', name, data}` envelope), and builds custom bulk/incremental messages from `world.onDiff`. Speed 0 maps to `world.pause()` — never `setSpeed(0)`, which throws.

## Module boundaries

- `src/sim/` — pure game logic on civ-engine. No DOM, no Three, no timers, no Math.random/Date.now. Everything deterministic and headless-testable. Exports `createCitySim(config)` (the world-factory) and shared types.
- `src/protocol/` — message types both sides import. No logic beyond type guards. Every payload must be structured-clone-safe plain data.
- `src/worker/` — thin host: instantiate world via factory, drive the engine loop (`world.start()`; 1x/2x/4x via `setSpeed`, pause via `pause()`/`resume()` — never `setSpeed(0)`), submit commands via `world.submitWithResult`, and project `world.onDiff` into protocol messages over postMessage. No engine `ClientAdapter`/`RenderAdapter`; no game rules here.
- `src/rendering/` — Three.js only. Consumes protocol messages into a RenderStore (entity views keyed by id+generation), builds/updates GPU resources. Never imports `sim/`.
- `src/ui/` — DOM HUD (vanilla TS, no framework; keep it lean). Reads UiStore, dispatches commands via a single `submitCommand` funnel. Shared UI chrome lives in `hud-style.ts` so the top HUD, advisor, budget, inspect, legend, warning, and toast surfaces keep one Cities: Skylines-inspired dark civic planning skin without pulling render or sim code into UI.
- `src/app/` — composition root: boot worker, wire stores, input → active tool → command, render loop.
- `src/harness/` — dev-only playtest/replay adapters. It wraps the composition-root game surface, recorder messages, and real `PlayerInput` events. The civ-engine visual playtest host lives here and may read UI labels / screenshot / text state, but it must not bypass the real player surface for visual-loop actions.
- `src/persistence/` — save/load: requests snapshot from worker, versions it, localStorage + file export/import; load path re-creates the worker world from snapshot.

## Worker protocol (v1)

Source of truth for implemented shapes: `src/protocol/messages.ts`. Notable divergences from the sketch below as built: the `vehicles` message is a full per-tick list `{topologyVersion, list:[{id, edge, t, reverse}]}` rather than upserts/removed; `field` messages carry `width`, `height`, and `defaultValue` alongside sparse cells; the inspect panel reads client-side building views (no `inspect` round-trip exists yet); `requestSnapshot`/`loadSnapshot` land in phase 6.

Client → worker: `{type:'command', name, data}` (one per player action; a custom envelope the worker hands to `world.submitWithResult` — not the engine `ClientAdapter` — with in-sim validation), `{type:'setSpeed', speed: 0|1|2|4}` (worker maps 1/2/4 to `world.setSpeed` and 0 to `world.pause()`/`resume()`; never `setSpeed(0)`, which throws), `{type:'requestSnapshot'}` (save), `{type:'loadSnapshot', snapshot, meta}`, `{type:'setFieldSubscriptions', fields[]}` (active overlay only), `{type:'inspect', entityId}` (info-panel round-trip).

Worker → client: `{type:'ready', gridW, gridH, terrain, seed}` (once; terrain is static after gen EXCEPT the tree mask — the renderer derives current trees locally as the initial mask minus road cells minus building/structure footprints, so no tree message exists; the sim's landValue nearTrees input reads the same derived view sim-side), `{type:'zones', cells:[{i, zone}]}` (bulk; on zone/dezone and after load), `{type:'buildings', upserts: BuildingView[], removed: entityId[]}` (incremental, built from `world.onDiff` — not an engine `RenderAdapter`), `{type:'vehicles', topologyVersion, list: VehicleView[]}` (full per-tick list while any vehicle exists), `{type:'frame', tick, stats}` (every tick; small — no events array; toasts come from commandRejected and save responses), `{type:'field', name, blockSize, cells}` (sparse block updates on that field's cadence, only when subscribed), `{type:'traffic', edges:[{id, bucket}]}` (on congestion-epoch change; phase 3), `{type:'networks', power:{lineCells, plantIds}, water:{pipeCells, pumpIds}}` (on network recompute; phase 5), `{type:'inspectResult', ...}` (building details, residents, jobs, score inputs), `{type:'snapshot', snapshot, meta}` (save response), `{type:'commandRejected', name, code, message}` (surfaced as UI toast).

After `{type:'loadSnapshot'}` the worker responds with a fresh full sync — `ready` (terrain regenerated from the restored seed), `roads`, `zones`, a full `buildings` upsert, `frame` — the same sequence as initial boot.

Projected render views are minimal per archetype: buildings `{kind:'rci'|'service'|'utility', zone, level, cells:[x,y,w,h], abandoned, powered, watered, structureType?}` where `structureType` identifies non-RCI structures (fireStation, police, clinic, school, coalPlant, windTurbine, waterPump); vehicles `{kind:'vehicle', travel:{edge, t}, topologyVersion}` (renderer resolves geometry via its road-graph mirror, keeping the previous graph until no vehicle view references it); roads are NOT entities in the render stream — road cell set + derived graph geometry arrive as a `{type:'roads', topologyVersion, cells, edges}` message on topology change (cheaper than per-cell entities and the renderer needs edges for vehicle interpolation anyway).

## Rendering plan

- Terrain: one static group from the `ready` terrain: vertex-colored land, recessed water, vertical shore skirts, and sandy shoreline detail strips on real land-water borders (all renderer-only; the sim water mask stays authoritative). Trees: synchronized instanced trunks plus two-tier canopies over the renderer's locally derived tree view — initial mask minus road cells minus building/structure footprints, with deterministic scale/rotation/color variation and no extra tree message.
- Roads: merged BufferGeometry rebuilt from the full `roads` message on topology changes; chunked dirty rebuilds are a later performance path once road payloads become large enough to justify them. Land roads are flat asphalt quads with separate synchronized surface-detail and lane-marking layers; intersections remain flat quads. Bridge cells render through the concrete causeway mesh.
- Zones: a grouped renderer layer with translucent zone tint plus inset earth/stone lot-ground details. Both meshes rebuild from the same `zones` payload and hide cells covered by building or service footprints, so empty planned lots read as settlement groundwork while grown buildings stay visually clean.
- Buildings: one instanced RCI wall/roof/detail/facade stack per zone with abandoned variant tint via instance color, plus service wall/roof/detail archetypes (fireStation, police, clinic, school). Utility visuals are separate `NetworksView` geometry: plant/pump footprint blocks, sparse power poles and wires, and pipe hints from `networks` messages. Procedural low-poly box+roof geometry, footprint-scaled, with modest roof overhangs, roofline detail blocks, and front facade panels so districts and civic services read at strategy zoom without copied source assets. Rebuild RCI and service instance buffers incrementally from `buildings` and `structures` messages.
- Vehicles: single `InstancedMesh` (capacity 600). Per frame: for each vehicle view, sample its edge polyline at `t` (+ per-tick lerp between last two sim states, renderer-owned), set instance matrix. Instance color by speed (white→red) for readable congestion.
- Field overlays: one 64x64 (or 32x32 for blockSize 4) `DataTexture` per active field on a transparent plane above terrain; updated from sparse `field` messages. Only the active overlay is subscribed.
- Camera: `MapControls` (orbit/pan/zoom, angle-clamped). Picking: raycast against the ground plane → cell coords; tools draw ghost previews client-side and validate optimistically (authoritative validation in-sim; rejection → toast + ghost flash).
- Day/night (phase 6): renderer-local sun/ambient animation keyed to sim day fraction from `frame`.

## Sim internals worth pinning

- System registry: single ordered registration list in `world-factory.ts` (deterministic registration order is a replay contract). Phases: input = command handlers only; update = growth/citizens/traffic/utilities; postUpdate = fields, demand, economy; output = stats projection.
- `createCitySim` takes explicit flags `{fieldsEnabled, utilitiesEnabled}` (both false until their phase — fields in phase 4, utilities in phase 5). Disabled fields read landValue = 30, coverage 0, educated false; disabled utilities read powered = watered = true. The flags stay supported forever so early-phase scenario tests remain valid.
- Road graph, OccupancyGrid, Layers, and the PathRequestQueue are game-owned singletons living OUTSIDE World state — with their authoritative source persisted where `world.serialize()` sees it: road cells live in a `roadCells` world-state record (small, written only on player action), pending trips as component data, and layer states as components on a dedicated singleton "mirror" entity (one component per layer, written only on that layer's recompute cadence). Layers go on the mirror entity rather than into `world.setState(...)` because world-state values are JSON-fingerprinted twice per tick by the engine, while component diffs are dirty-flag-only. OccupancyGrid and other derived maps are NOT mirrored anywhere. After `applySnapshot` (load/replay), `rebuildDerived(world)` reconstructs graph/occupancy/queue from entities and world state and layers from the mirror components. This function is the single choke point keeping derived caches honest.
- Traffic vs topology changes: edge identity is a geometry key (string of the two endpoint cells + the first path cell). On graph rebuild the sim remaps in-flight vehicles' edge ids via the geometry-key map; vehicles referencing vanished edges despawn (counted in `disconnectedTrips`; the citizen's trip is cancelled). PathCache key is (fromNode, toNode) only; one monotonic `pathVersion` counter bumps on EITHER topology change or congestion-epoch change (no packed-version arithmetic); `clearCache()` on topology change.
- Determinism: strict mode on; the only RNG is `world.random()`; queues drain deterministically; congestion epochs and buckets are integer state in world state. CI runs a 2,000-tick synthetic playtest (scripted policy building a small city) and asserts `SessionReplayer.selfCheck().ok`.

## Performance budgets (from civ-engine benchmarks on this machine)

- Entities ≤ ~6,000 (2k citizens + ≤600 vehicles + ~1–2k buildings + services): engine ticks this in ≤ ~5 ms; budget 50 ms/tick at 20 TPS.
- Pathfinding: road graph ≤ ~1k nodes; 8 path resolutions/tick budgeted through the queue; cached hits ~0.01 ms.
- Diff payloads at this scale ~25–50 KB/tick worst case; fields throttled to their cadence and subscription.
- Render: instancing keeps draw calls ≈ #archetypes + chunks + overlays ≤ ~50. Target 60 fps; hard floor 30 fps at v1 acceptance scale.

## Testing strategy

- Contract tests per mechanic in `tests/sim/` using scenario helpers: build world → submit commands → step N → assert (growth happened, vehicle count > 0, field values in range, budget changed…).
- Pure-function unit tests for road-graph derivation, footprint search, L-path drag expansion, demand math.
- Determinism gate: synthetic playtest + replay selfCheck (see above) in `npm test`.
- Renderer/UI verified through the browser game-testing loop (`render_game_to_text()`, screenshots), not unit tests. `render_game_to_text()` reports: tick, population, treasury, demand, vehicle count, camera, active tool, and a coarse ASCII map — enough for an agent to close the loop without pixels.
- Harness adapters have browser-free contract tests for marker conversion, replay inspection, and the civ-engine visual playtest host; they assert that the visual loop maps actions to `PlayerInput`/`advance` rather than `command`.

## Key decisions

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sim on civ-engine in a worker, renderer on protocol messages only | determinism, headless tests, main-thread frame budget |
| 2 | Grid-aligned roads; road graph derived, traffic on graph not cells | engine-native fit; graph keeps A* small and caches effective |
| 3 | Roads/terrain/fields as bulk messages, not per-cell entities | thousands of cells would drown the entity diff stream |
| 4 | Citizens = household entities (≈3 pop each), capped vehicle agents | Skylines-credible agent traffic at browser-safe scale |
| 5 | Derived caches (graph/layers/occupancy) rebuilt from entities + mirror components via one `rebuildDerived` | save/load/replay correctness with non-serialized engine utilities |
| 6 | Vanilla-TS HUD, no React | small UI surface; avoids a framework dependency in the render path |
